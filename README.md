This app is currently on development mode on the Spotify API so in order to access the app via [`sclonetify`](https://sclonetify.jodarini.dev), i have to grant you access with your Spotify email/username or, alternatively, you can use these non-premium credentials:

Test acc:
```
sclonetifytest@gmail.com
```
Test pwd: 
```
test12345!
```

In order to use the player, you'll need Spotify Premium.

To run this locally, follow the documentation on [`Spotify`](api.spotify.com) and [`Clerk`](www.clerk.com), you need your own .env variables.

This app is desktop only.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
